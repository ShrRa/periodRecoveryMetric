# periodRecoveryMetric
Rubin MAF metric for testing how phase coverage affects the quality of determination of the periods of variable stars. The structure of the repository:

simcodes - Auxilliary template lightcurves, LC generation and period determination code for the scientific analysis. Credits to Kresimir Tisanic. 
The paper describing these LCs and the code is in preparation, so some changes are possible.

KuiperMetric.py - the metric code
Short_periods.ipynb - Jupyter notebook demonstrating how the metric can be used and implementing some basic scientific analysis
Long_Periods_WIP.ipynb - same as Short_periods.ipynb, but for longer periods of variability
PointSlicerTest.ipynb - testing the metric on poing coordinates
PointSlicerTest5years.ipynb - Fine-time-comb Kuiper values for point coordinates for 5 years
pointKuipValues5years.csv - results of the fine-time-comb analysis for point coordinates
